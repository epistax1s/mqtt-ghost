# DSL: Key Ideas and Purpose

## Introduction

The utility uses a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) based on Groovy to configure and manage an MQTT client. Each DSL file 
defines a single client, including its connection to the broker, message publishing, topic subscriptions, and other actions.

:::tip Groovy :)

Built on Groovy, a scripting language for the JVM, this DSL offers great flexibility. You can write custom functions and
code directly in the DSL file on the fly, adapting logic, processing data, or prototyping quickly without limits.

:::

The DSL comprises four main components that allow you to flexibly configure the client's behavior:

- **connect**: Sets up the connection to the MQTT broker (host, port, credentials, SSL).
- **publish**: Publishes messages to topics with configurable payload, QoS, retained flag, and scheduling options.
- **subscribe**: Subscribes to topics and processes incoming messages using Groovy code.
- **action**: Defines a named code block that can be invoked from other parts of the DSL or scheduled to run periodically.

## Overview of Components

### 1. Connect

The `connect` component is used to configure the connection parameters for the MQTT broker. Within this block, you specify 
the details required to establish a connection, such as host, port, credentials, and SSL settings (if needed).

**Syntax**:

```groovy
connect {
    host = "broker.hivemq.com"
    port = 1883
}
```

### 2. Subscribe

The `subscribe` component enables you to subscribe to MQTT topics and handle incoming messages using custom logic. When
a message arrives on the specified topic, the provided closure is executed to process the data.

**Syntax**:

```groovy
subscribe("topic_pattern") { msg ->
    // Message processing logic
}
```

### 3. Publish

The `publish` component allows you to configure the publishing of messages to an MQTT topic. You can specify the topic,
payload, QoS, retained flag, and even set up scheduling and pre-/post-execution code.

**Syntax**:

```groovy
publish("action_name") {
    topic = "your/topic"
    payload = "your_message"
    qos = qos_level // 0, 1, or 2
    retain = true/false
    schedule {
        interval = interval_in_millis
        startImmediately = true/false
    }
}
```

### 4. Action

The action component lets you create named code blocks that can be invoked from other parts of the DSL or scheduled for 
periodic execution.

**Syntax**:

```groovy
action('action_name') {
    // Any Groovy code
}
```

## Interactions Between Components

The DSL components can interact with one another, enabling the creation of complex and flexible scenarios. For example:

- **From subscribe**: You can trigger a `publish` or an `action`. When a message is received on a specific topic, it can 
activate a message publication or execute a named action.
- **From action**: You can call other `action` blocks or trigger a `publish` operation. Named actions can include logic 
that invokes other actions or publishes messages.
- **Chaining publish calls**: A `publish` operation can be configured to automatically trigger another publish after 
sending a message.
- **And so on**.

## Leveraging Groovy for Flexibility

Built on Groovy, a scripting language for the JVM, this DSL lets you write custom functions and code directly in the DSL
file. This means you can adapt the client’s behavior on the fly – adding logic, creating variables, processing data, or
prototyping – without being limited to predefined commands.

```groovy
def logMessage(String text) {
    println "Log: $text"
}

def messageCount = 0  // Variable to track received messages

subscribe("test/topic") { msg ->
    messageCount++    // Increment the counter
    logMessage("Message #$messageCount received: ${msg.payloadAsString}")
}
```

In this example, a messageCount variable is defined to track the number of received messages, and a logMessage function
is used to print logs with the counter.
